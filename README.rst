=======================================
Yuxuan Fan investigated Methods 1 and 2. In Method 2, he employed multiple models to explore the optimal model while considering scenarios where seniority levels typically do not decrease.
Yichen Gao investigated Method 6 (TF-IDF + logistic regression), implementing lightweight data augmentation, L1 regularization, and n-gram TF-IDF.
Diyora Ilyosova studied Method 6 using standard supervised learning approaches, extracting the top n-grams for each category and applying the model to LinkedIn JSON data, yielding stronger interpretability.
